      "q1_answer": "A carbon footprint calculator is a tool that quantifies greenhouse gas emissions generated by a company's activities. It measures direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect energy-related emissions (Scope 2), and other indirect emissions (Scope 3) according to international standards such as the GHG Protocol.",
      "q2_title": "What are the benefits of software for calculating a company's carbon footprint?",
      "q2_answer": "Carbon footprint calculation software offers several benefits: automated calculations, considerable time savings, data accuracy, real-time tracking, generation of regulation-compliant reports, identification of reduction levers, and support for strategic decision-making for ecological transition.",
      "q3_title": "How does Carbontrack's sustainability platform help companies measure their emissions?",
      "q3_answer": "Our Carbontrack platform simplifies emissions measurement through an intuitive interface, automatically updated emission factors, integration with your existing systems, customizable dashboards, and expert support to interpret results and define an action plan.",
      "q4_title": "Does Carbontrack calculate emissions for scopes 1, 2, and 3?",
      "q4_answer": "Yes, Carbontrack covers all emissions according to the GHG Protocol methodology: Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (electricity, heating, cooling), and Scope 3 (complete value chain). Our platform includes more than 15 Scope 3 categories for comprehensive measurement.",
      "q5_title": "What are the main features of carbon accounting software?",
      "q5_answer": "Main features include: automated calculation according to ISO 14064 and GHG Protocol standards, multi-user collaborative interface, customizable dashboards, CSRD-compliant report generation, reduction action tracking, alerts and notifications, API for integration, and included expert support.",
      "q6_title": "Why should companies calculate their carbon footprint?",
      "q6_answer": "Calculating carbon footprint has become essential to: comply with new regulations (CSRD, European taxonomy), meet investor and customer expectations, identify cost-saving opportunities, improve competitiveness, contribute to climate goals, and prepare for the future in the face of environmental challenges."
